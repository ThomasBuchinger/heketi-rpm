# heketi-rpm
This project is an unofficial build for [heketi](https://github.com/heketi/heketi) and is based on a Fedora src-rpm for heketi 9.0.0.

The heketi project does not provide rpm packages and I could not find any packaged versions for the most recent version. Therefore I downloaded the most recent src rpm I could find and built my own rpm package.

Thanks to Niels de Vos <ndevos@redhat.com> packaged the original [srpm](https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/32/Everything/source/tree/Packages/h/heketi-9.0.0-5.fc32.src.rpm)

**Note**: I am neither involved in heketi nor do I have any experience building high-quality RPM packages. Use at your own risk :)
