# heketi-rpm
This project is an unofficial build for [heketi](https://github.com/heketi/heketi) and is based on a Fedora src-rpm for heketi 9.0.0.

The heketi project does not provide rpm packages and I could not find any packaged versions for the most recent version. Therefore I downloaded the most recent src rpm I could find and built my own rpm package.

**Note**: I am neither involved in heketi nor do I have any eperience building high-quality RPM packages. Use at your own risk :)
